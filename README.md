# What is IOTA?

IOTA is a revolutionary new **transactional settlement** and **data transfer layer for the Internet of Things**. It’s based on a new distributed ledger, the Tangle, which gets rid off the inefficiencies of current Blockchain designs and introduces a new way of reaching consensus in a decentralized peer-to-peer system. For the first time ever, through IOTA people can transfer money without any fees. This means that even infinitesimally small nanopayments can be made through IOTA.

IOTA is the missing puzzle piece for the Machine Economy to fully emerge and reach its desired potential. We envision IOTA to be the public, permissionless backbone for the Internet of Things that enables true interoperability between all devices.

> ## IOTA IS CURRENTLY IN BETA

> It should be noted that IOTA is currently still in Beta. This means that the current Java implementation is a **reference implementation**. Major improvements to performance, features as well as ease of use will be made over the coming months.
